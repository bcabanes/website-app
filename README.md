## Development server

Run `npm run ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
You can use the `npm run ng generate` (or just `npm run ng g`) command to generate Angular components:

```bash
npm run ng generate component my-new-component
npm run ng g component my-new-component # using the alias

# components support relative path generation
# if in the directory src/app/feature/ and you run
npm run ng g component new-cmp
# your component will be generated in src/app/feature/new-cmp
# but if you were to run
npm run ng g component ../newer-cmp
# your component will be generated in src/app/newer-cmp
```
You can find all possible blueprints in the table below:

Scaffold  | Usage
---       | ---
Component | `npm run ng g component my-new-component`
Directive | `npm run ng g directive my-new-directive`
Pipe      | `npm run ng g pipe my-new-pipe`
Service   | `npm run ng g service my-new-service`
Class     | `npm run ng g class my-new-class`
Guard     | `npm run ng g guard my-new-guard`
Interface | `npm run ng g interface my-new-interface`
Enum      | `npm run ng g enum my-new-enum`
Module    | `npm run ng g module my-module`

## Build

Run `npm run ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `npm run ng serve`.
